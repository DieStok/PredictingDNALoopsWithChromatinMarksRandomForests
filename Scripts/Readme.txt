Please refer to Script manual.odt for sample usages of these scripts. Note that they were all written with specific HPC architecture
for running in mind, and hence have some hard-coded filepaths or defaults for that architecture. It is not possible to download
these scripts and easily run them all locally or on a different architecture without rewrites.
