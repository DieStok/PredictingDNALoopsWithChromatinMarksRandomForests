# PredictingDNALoopsWithChromatinMarksRandomForests
Contains the [report](ImportantDocumentation/writing/DieterFinalReportChromatinLoopPredictionWithRFClassifiers_ShortInternshipMCLS_2019.pdf) and code for my minor internship on predicting DNA loop formation using chromatin marks at and between loop anchors using Random Forest classifiers. Conducted under the auspices of Dr. Jeroen de Ridder and Dr. Amin Allahyar. Thanks to Geert Geeven, Valerio Bianchi and Wouter de Laat for data and/or fruitful discussion. Due to being unpublished, the data for the DNA loops in heart tissue is not included in this repository. Please refer to this BioRxiv post for details on this data: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/705715v1. Since the classifier works on GM12878 and Heart loops together and does not work with only half the data, I have opted to keep all data under wraps for now. It is available upon request. The code for the Drosophila deep learning replication experiment mentioned in Supplementary data 1 is not in this repository as it was a side-project, but is available upon request as well. run_script.sh was made by Dr. Amin Allahyar.
